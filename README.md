🐶 I’m interested in create projects to help friends and familly to improve their business on the WW.  
🌱 I’m currently learning NextJs after ReactJs -> It's a long way to the top, but I love it! 😁
😅By the way, you cant take a look to my last projects, They are not projects that are going to change the world, but...
